-----------

Simple code (`*py`) and results (`2min_tic_kic.txt`) on 2-minute TESS targets observed by Kepler and TESS. This is a simple check using James Davenport's kic2tic (https://github.com/jradavenport/kic2tic/) catalog, and then checking the MAST archive for 2minute lightcurves. In reality, I cut the `check_2minute.py` into chunks of data, and did "parallel queries".

First column of the `2min_tic_kic.txt` file is TIC ID, second is KIC ID.
